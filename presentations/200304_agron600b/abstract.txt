Title: Providing the E in G x E x M

Abstract: The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) is an ISU Agronomy
project that aims to provide synthesized datasets relevant to support
agronomic research and Iowa's Ag Economy.  This talk will detail the
datasets made available by this project and how they are used by
modeling projects like the Daily Erosion Project and Dr Archontoulis's
FACTs Project.  Finding and understanding the environmental data necessary
to support soil science can be extremely confounding.  This talk will
attempt to demystify available datasets and provide tips for their 
application.

Bio: Daryl Herzmann is a System's Analyst in Agronomy and has worked on
the IEM since its founding in 2001.  He has a bachelor's degree in
Meteorology and enjoys ths apex of physical and computer science.
