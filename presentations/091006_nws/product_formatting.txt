Musing on the Formatting of NWS Products

(Data presented through 4 October 2009)

Basis for NWS Product Formatting is NWSI 10-1701 which references WMO 386.
Section 2.1 establishes:
   Narrative text uses upper case and only the following punctuation marks 
   in the text: the period (.), and the three dot ellipsis (...); the 
   forward slash (/); the dash (-); and the plus (+). 

So our character set is: A-Z . / - +

Section 2.2 adds exceptions to increase character set: A-Z . / - + $ & > * =

Section 2.3 adds more exceptions for encoded products like SHEF.

  Many SVR and TOR products contain the exclaimation point, for example:
   
  DAMAGE HAS BEEN REPORTED WITH THIS STORM!  THIS STORM IS EXTREMELY 
  DANGEROUS!  TAKE COVER NOW!!

  For 2009, the number of products (and percentage) that contain these
  four unallowed characters:
           !        @        '        :       Total 
   SV   3578(18)  331( 2)  405( 2)  205( 1)   20193
   FF    143( 4)   66( 2)  182( 5)   87( 3)    3432
   TO    533(18)   15( 1)   40( 1)   15( 1)    2934
   FA     65( 5)    6( 1)   62( 5)   25( 2)    1199
   MA     48( 1)    0( 0)   28( 1)   25( 1)    3522

The @ symbol is allowed in "administrative-type products and PNS", can not
be used in short-duration warning products. Example Tornado Warning with the
@ in it:

   PLEASE REPORT HAIL...OR DAMAGING WINDS TO THE NATIONAL WEATHER
   SERVICE BY CALLING TOLL FREE AT 1-877-633-6772...OR BY EMAIL AT
   BGM.STORMREPORT@NOAA.GOV

Another frequently misused character is the double quote ("), example

   FLSCRP
   UNDER THE "CURRENT CONDITIONS" SUBMENU...CLICK 
   ON "RIVER FORECASTS" WHICH TAKES YOU TO OUR AHPS WEB PAGE.

Section 3.4 notes line length to be 69 characters *with* the <cr><cr><lf>

   20,695 out of approximately 75,000 AFDs in 2009 violated this.

Section 3.6 states that "A Blank Line" should be used between major format
blocks.  The justification is for easier reading (by humans or computers?)
What is "a blank line"?  3 character <cr><cr><lf> or an indefinite number
of "unseen" spaces with the line feed?

   Most products have no issues with the 3 character blank line, but there
   are a few that have template issues(?) that some offices have fixed.
   RVF  RVA  QPS  HYD are the main offenders

Section 4.1.2 states a 6 character AWIPS CI is required, with spaces inserted
when necessary.

   My ingestor has only caught this on RTP products, the latest being:
   200910041234-KBMX-ASUS64-RTPAL

Section 5.1.3,4 notes that content-type separators && and $$ are to be
on their own line with no other characters than <cr><cr><lf>.

   The main product violators of this are: RVF  AFD  RVS  and FLS , but
   the frequency is less than 10%.

Lower case letters are not all that frequent, but do occur on the most 
frequent product issued every minute:

  NTUS96 KNCF 051358
  WTSNCF
  THIS IS A COMMUNICATIONS TEST MESSAGE ORIGINATING FROM THE WNCF
