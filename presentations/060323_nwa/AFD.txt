.DISCUSSION...

...HIGH RISK FOR A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM OUTBREAK TODAY WITH VERY 
LARGE HAIL DAMAGING WINDS AND A POTENTIAL FOR STRONG AND LONG-TRACK
TORNADOES OVER THE ENTIRE AREA...

TODAY IS ONE OF THOSE DAYS OF DAYS WE ALL DREAD. CONDITIONS ARE 
GOING TO BE RIPE FOR A POTENTIALLY DISASTEROUS DAY OF WEATHER
FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA OF MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS.  

THE STORM PREDICTION CENTER HAS ISSUED A PUBLIC WEATHER OUTLOOK
HEADLINING THE SPECIFICS OF THE VOLATILITY OF THE WEATHER TODAY
AND TONIGHT.  AN UNUSUALLY STRONG UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM WILL 
APPROACH THE BISTATE AREA FROM THE WEST. STRONG PRESSURE FALLS 
HAVE ALREADY BEGUN OVER CENTRAL KANSAS AND NEBRASKA. A TEMPORARY
SURGE OF COOLER AIR HAS DROPPED TO A POINT FROM CHICAGO TO 50 MILES
SOUTH OF ST LOUIS TO SPRINGFIELD BUT IT WILL STOP AND RETURN
BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. THE AIR IS EXTREMELY UNSTABLE
AND WARM HUMID AIR WILL RETURN NORTH ACROSS THE BISTATE AREA
WITH EXPLOSIVE THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT FORECAST TO BEGIN BY
MIDDAY. 

EVERY EMERGENCY MANAGER...EVERY SPOTTER...EVERY MEDIA SOURCE
THAT HAS WEATHER COVERAGE...AND EVERY PERSON SHOULD MAKE WEATHER
THE TOP PRIORITY. LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL SHOULD PLAN TO HAVE
EXTRA PEOPLE ON TAP TO HANDLE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.  SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH DAMAGING LARGE HAIL...STRONG WINDS...AND STRONG
LONG-TRACK AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY TORNADOES ARE LIKELY TODAY AND
TONIGHT.  

STORMS THAT FORM COULD BECOME TORNADIC IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.
PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES SHOULD START NOW.
