Title: IEM Potpourri

Abstract: Since 2001, the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) has been 
efforting the collection of various datasets.  This effort has yielded a 
data warehouse over two terabytes in size and a good number of 'war 
stories' detailing its acquisition.  This presentation will provide a 
"potpourri" of caveats, gotchas, catch-22s, and disclaimers to many of the 
datasets researchers use every day, some of them provided by the IEM.
