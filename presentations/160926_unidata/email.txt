Mike,

I think you've hit the jackpot for Daryl and me in terms of finding that
ancient history email thread.   I'll send a copy of this to Daryl to
confirm it's the one he was thinking of.   Daryl and I owe you a beer or
two (cases) for this.   Many many thanks.   It brings back great memories
of a wonderful time for me.
