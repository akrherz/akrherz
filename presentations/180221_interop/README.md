Session Title:  The National Weather Service Valid Time Event Code (VTEC)
and Event ID Reuse

Abstract:
  For nearly all National Weather Service (NWS) alerts, they use a computer
code system called Valid Time Event Code (VTEC) to track the lifecycle of
the alerts.  This presentation will talk about the mechanics of VTEC and
summarize various issues found with its implementation that could cause
misunderstandings for processing the information.

Iowa State University back in 2001.  The IEM is a data warehousing project
that collects, processes, archives, and disseminates disparate environmental
datasets covering Iowa and beyond.  Daryl has worked on a number of
environmental data and alerting platforms and was a co-creator of the
"NWSChat" platform, which is used by the NWS to collaborate with Emergency
Management, Media and other partners.  Daryl is happy to enage folks over
