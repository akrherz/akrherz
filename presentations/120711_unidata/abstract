An overused buzz-word currently in academia is 'trans-disciplinary
research'.  While the concept is altruistic, the implementation in actual
collaborative research is problematic.  Outside of the traditional
communication issues between scientists from disparate disciplines, the
gulf between their computational systems can often be the biggest hurdle.
For example, hydrologists and meteorologists often struggle with moving
data between their data systems due to the rather large differences in
data formats and discipline centric software systems.  Is there a simple
solution to this? Well no, but the programming language Python presents an
attractive means to bridge these gaps.

This presentation provides an overview of how Python can be used within   
the atmospheric science discipline to work with disparate datasets from
other disciplines and to provide your data to them in formats they can 
work with.  Concrete examples of using Python to do things include:

 * routing data from Unidata's Local Data Manager (LDM) to Twitter
 * generating GIS-ready imagery and grids from Grib2 data
 * doing iterative science with IPython and matplotlib
 * Using web services to build long time-series datasets.
