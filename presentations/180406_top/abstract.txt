Title: Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) - Dog and Pony Show

Abstract: The IEM is a 17 year old project at Iowa State University with 
the goal of collecting and disseminating environmental data.  While the 
project name implies a limited spatial domain, the subversive goal has 
been world domination by collecting data wherever it is found.  The 
ongoing result of this goal is a tremendously confusing and complex 
website rivaling that of NCDC or even the NWS.  The "Dog and Pony Show" 
will consist of:
  - presenting tools on the website that may help the bureau do its job, 
  - assorted rants and statistics on various bureau programs like storm
    based warnings,
  - examination of two IEM barnyard animals: IEM Cow and IEM Raccoon,
  - and accounting of IEM archiving activities.

The IEM's developer, daryl herzmann, was also a contractor for the weather 
bureau and the primary developer of NWSChat.  A wild and enthralling time 
is sure to be had by all during the presentation.
