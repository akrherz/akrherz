boss wants me to plug sustainablecorn website

[ ] send to Ethan for evaluation

Ethan questions

  *   What distance from your field does weather station data need to be to
be relevant to you?
  *   What interest do you have in your own weather station, and what data
do you need at the field level?
  *   What data do you want to see in your area but do not need at the farm
level?
  *   Is forecasting or data from recent events more relevant to your
operation?
  *   How do you receive weather forecast and recent event data? Smart phone
apps (which ones?), computer sites (which ones?), local news, etc.
  *   Do you use any weather data sites such as mesonet or climate corp (any
others?) ?
  *   Would an app that uses recent weather events to alert you for possible
scouting events be useful?
  *   How does the forecast effect field work planning, and how accurate do
you believe your weather forecast source is?
  *   Do you know about ISU's mesonet, is it helpful, do you understand the
data, what measurements/sensors are important to you?
  *   Is climate change/changing weather patterns a concern for your
operation? What changes are you making due to this? ( Not sure if we want to
get into climate change or not)
