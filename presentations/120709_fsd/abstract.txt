TITLE:  Barnyard Weather Fun: Cows & Raccoons. An update and mussings from
        the world of storm based warnings, severe weather archives, and
        general trouble making.

*Abstract: *The Iowa Environmental Mesonet, a project at Iowa State
University, continues to add to its giant pile of environmental data.
 Various barnyard animals, including a cow and raccoon, rummage through
this pile of data, producing products especially tailored for NWS use. On a
typical farm, these products would be hauled out into the field for
fertilizer, but in this case they are brought to the NWS office for
discussion.  The purpose of this talk is to detail these animals, talk
about the storm based warning system, and plans related to other computer
systems Daryl develops (NWSChat, nwsbot, etc).
