IEM Update: From pollen to rivers to pavements to soils and a whole lot 
more.

The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) was created back in 2001 with the 
vision of providing an one stop shop for environmental data for the state 
of Iowa.  This data has been collected from partners providing access to 
their datasets.  To date, the IEM has collected nearly 1 billion 
observations.  The goal of assembling such a large and diverse dataset was 
to spur cross discipline research and collaboration.  Such research 
projects include the modellling of maize pollen dispersion, forecasting 
the river stage on Squaw Creek, modelling roadway wear, and analysis of 
statewide soil erosion.

This talk presents an update on these research projects and a whole lot 
more.
