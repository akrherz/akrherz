Subject: Re: USWRP Workshop 

I have a few things to keep in mind. When am I ever non-vocal?
1. Surface data assimilation: Surface data is almost last on the list for 
having an impact on model forecasts that use surface data. Most times 
surface is ignored altogether. With grid resolution decreasing, it would 
seem a priority to understand how we can better assimilate surface data.
I guess the most important aspect of this is during convection. if we are 
behind an outflow boundary how can we incorporate these obs up into the 
pbl in order to have an impact on the model run?

2. Mesonetwork design (test beds): when designing keep in mind the time to 
space conversion concept. it is always nice to design a grid, but 
sometimes that can't be done. So the problems defaults to optimizing the 
placement of a limited number of sensors.

I am not sure what they are asking for in the NWP part of all this. seems 
like a talk about decentralizing the NWP part of the weather service. To 
me that seems like a bad idea. To me a regional center, would take the 
centralized model output (say ETA model output) and use that as BC's and 
IC's for regional NWP such as ensemble modelling. Or even just to run 
different parameterizations based on regional characteristics (higher 
terrain, agricultural land use, coastal regions, etc.) then local data 
assimilation could be run (the people who know the data best could specify 
how reliable it is). Then the regional product could be provided as a 
guide to local NWS offices. 
well there is my 3 cents.
