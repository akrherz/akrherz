Daryl,

I think you'll want to comment for sure on the IEM and experiences here.

My bigger concern would be with regard to the 2nd workshop.  Many groups 
around the country are already doing real-time forecasting helping nearby 
NWS offices.  We aren't really involved in that (although you and Dave did 
or still do some MM5/ETA runs), but we have tons of expertise on warm 
season issues, and do research runs all the time.  It is simply by choice 
we haven't established a regional prediction center here.   If the 
workshop begins discussion about actually setting up a network of regional 
sites doing prediction, I'd like it if you can make a strong case that ISU 
would like to represent the Corn Belt area.  In other words, we don't want 
to be overlooked just because we don't do what U of Wash or OU-CAPS are 
already doing.   The vast majority of all of our yearly precip happens in 
summer convective systems, which normally happen at night.  This is a 
unique weather situation and one that we have lots of experience 
addressing.  If needed, our ammo includes:
1) expertise in studying the LLJ
2) expertise in land/surface impacts on weather/precip
3) we run locally MM5, WRF, and ETA and could run all in real-time
4) we are engaged in mixed physics/mixed model ensemble work and might be 
able to do a limited size ensemble in real time
5) we have even looked at neural network systems for prediction and could 
tie in things like that.

I think Cliff Mass, the organizer, is aware of all of this because he said 
some nice things to me in Canada in Sept.  But, with me not there and ISU 
not doing daily forecasts, if they do get aggressive and plan on a 
national network of regional prediction centers, you may have to speak up, 
because Chris and I (at the least) think ISU should be a player.
