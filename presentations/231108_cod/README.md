Using the Iowa Environmental Mesonet for Fun and/or Profit
=============

While having an inconspicuous name, the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) website
has a mind bending number of tools, download portals, and very unique datasets that
you may not even knew existed!  Unfitting of the name, most of these datasets are not
bound by the political boundary of the great state of Iowa!
Daryl Herzmann, the project's proprietor, has been
chunking away at the website since early 2001 and will present an overview of the
various datasets offered.  He will also discuss how the IEM website facilitates
"Reproducible Science" and "Open Source" through permissible licensing of data/software
and full source code distribution on Github.
