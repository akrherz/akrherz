\begin{abstract}
Our seminal 2018 Christmas Letter (Herzmann et al., 2018) attributed the passage
of another year's worth of time to attrition.  The same was not to be true for the
year 2020.  This letter summarizes our fortunate year of surviving \textit{COVID-19},
the Derecho of 10 August 2020, virtual schooling, and the presidential election.

\section{Introduction} 

The size of our family was unchanged this year and comprises Daryl
\enquote{Daryl} (42), Elizabeth \enquote{Liz} (28+),
Margaret \enquote{Maggie Moo} (7), Robert \enquote{Ro-Ro} (6), Charlotte
 \enquote{Charly Friend} (3), and one cat with a dog's name of Snoopy (12). 
We are thankful to have survived the various calamities of 2020 and the
children from each other.
   
\subsection{Housing}

Our house has not moved and thankfully survived the 15 minutes of 70-80 MPH
wind gusts during the August derecho.  The only damage is shown by Figure 1 with
the cheap charcoal grill busting out a side of a poorly constructed deck.
The immediate lesson learned was to acquire a propane grill (Hill, 2003).

\end{figurehere}

To bouy the economy, we decided to effort a large number of remodeling projects
around the house. We a) replaced the roof, b) replaced 6 exterior doors and
windows (Figure 2), c) replaced kid destroyed dinning room carpet with plank, d) replaced 
kitchen penisula with an island and e) daryl finally got a broken kitchen cabinet
fixed after eight years of supposed home ownership.

\subsection{Employment}

Daryl is somehow still employed by Iowa State University even though he only
moves between the computer, refrigerator, and bathroom each day.  His productivity
is at an all time low with one or more children home each day.  Good times. Not
driving to work each day does potentially save money (Figure 3).

Liz continues to vascillate between full time virtual, hybrid and full time
in-person teaching.

The children understand the compensation side of doing work, but have yet to
develop expensive tastes that would motivate the desire to do more work
for more compensation.  We continue to work on instilling American Values in
this regard.

\section{Miss Charlotte}

The astute reader would denote that Charlotte's nickname last year was
\textit{Charly Burger}.  The \textit{Burger} portion apropos for causing
family grief.  She has acutely conceptualized this and no longer wants that
moniker. "\textit{I am not a Burger}" she says and so we call her \textit{Friend}
now.  She enjoys hoarding mommy's dry erase markers and spilling trivial amounts of
food on her clothes so that she can sashay around the house in her underwear. 

\section{Mr Robert}

Robert says that Zoom schooling is the best form of schooling.  He has a school provided Chromebook
of his own that he diligently only does his assigned work on and does not spend
time watching YouTube, PBS Kids, nor football highlights. He has the same teacher as
Maggie had for first grade, as was the case for Kindergarten.  Maggie is the angel
student that tricks the teachers into wanting the next sibling in line.

Robert is happy for the big snowfalls we have already had this season.  He loves
to go outside and push snow in arbitrary directions. He likes wrestling with his
daddy and eating grilled cheese sandwiches.

\section{Summary}

We will continue to learn, love, and laugh together.  Liz and Daryl continue
to try to take things slowly and enjoy this precious time we have with the young
children.
