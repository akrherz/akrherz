# Howdy

I'm daryl and within here lies a lot of clunky code.  What I lack for skill, I make up for with effort.

## BIO

- I work for [Iowa State University](https://iastate.edu) and my primary project is the [Iowa Environmental Mesonet](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu).
- You can find me on the Twitter [@akrherz](https://twitter.com/akrherz).
- My degree is in Meteorology, so if you believe what the weather person says, it is your own fault.
